<p>Welcome to my website! My name is Pratyush and I am a data scientist, writer, traveller, and book reader with an occasional love for DOTA 2.</p>
<p>I am always on the lookout for new and exciting things to learn, experiment with, and build. My passion for technology and innovation drives me to explore various proof-of-concept applications, and I love sharing my findings and experiences with others. If you are interested in learning about my experiments and discoveries, be sure to follow me on this blog.</p>
<p>I write about a variety of topics, including data science, books, and automation. I believe in sharing the lessons I've learned on my personal journey, without preaching or telling others what to do. If you are interested in any of these topics, you'll enjoy reading my posts.</p>
<p>I really enjoy travelling and frequently come across amazing stories that I simply cannot keep to myself. I'll be sure to share my experiences with you, whether it's a new place I've visited or an interesting book I've read.</p>
<p>I currently work as a Data Scientist, where I assist in the development and scaling of predictive intelligence. Previously, I worked as a Consultant, assisting companies with advanced analytics and data science.</p>
